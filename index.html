        <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a
          simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
          together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application
          development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
        <p>
          The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for
          all major platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same
          site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools,
          and additional documentation.</p>
        <p>
          The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other
          languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
        </p>
        <p>This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and
          system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are
          self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.</p>
        <p>
          For a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library. The Python Language
          Reference gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and
          Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference Manual. There are also several books covering
          Python in depth.</p>

        <p>
          If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For
          example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and
          rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or
          a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.</p>
        <p>
          If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find
          the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a
          library and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an
          extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.</p>

        <p>Python is just the language for you.</p>

        <p>You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are
          best at moving around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could
          write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program.
          Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, macOS, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the
          job done more quickly.</p>

        <p>Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for
          large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more
          error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as
          flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger
          problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.
        <p>

        <p>Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes
          with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to
          start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls,
          sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.</p>

        <p>Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no
          compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to
          experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up
          program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.</p>

        <p>Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much
          shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement
          </li>
          <li>
            statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets
          </li>
          <li>
            no variable or argument declarations are necessary
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Python is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to
          the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to
          libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are
          really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension
          or command language for that application.

        <p>
          In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>> and
          …): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do
          not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in
          an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.</p>

        <p>You can toggle the display of prompts and output by clicking on >>> in the upper-right corner of an example
          box. If you hide the prompts and output for an example, then you can easily copy and paste the input lines
          into your interpreter.</p>

        <p>Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments
          in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear
          at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character
          within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted
          by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.</p>

        Some examples:
        <code>
# this is the first comment
spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
        # ... and now a third!
text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."

        <h2>Using Python As A Calculator</h2>

      <article>
        <p>Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait for the primary prompt, >>>. (It
          shouldn’t take long.)</p>
        <p>Numbers</p>
        <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value.
          Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for
          example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:</p>
        <code>
    >>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 50 - 5*6
20
>>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
5.0
>>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
1.6
  </code>
        <p>The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type
          float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.

          Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result (discarding any fractional
          result) you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:</p>
        <code>
>>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
5.666666666666667
>>>
>>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
5
>>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
2
>>> 5 * 3 + 2  # floored quotient * divisor + remainder
17
</code>
        <p>
          With Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate powers 1:
        </p>
        <code>
>>> 5 ** 2  # 5 squared
25
>>> 2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7
128
</code>
        <p>The equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, no result is displayed before the
          next interactive prompt:</p>
        <code>
>>> width = 20
>>> height = 5 * 9
>>> width * height
900
</code>
        <p>
          If a variable is not “defined” (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error:
        </p>
        <code>
>>> n  # try to access an undefined variable
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'n' is not defined
</code>
        <p>There is full support for floating point; operators with mixed type operands convert the integer operand to
          floating point:</p>
        <code>
>>> 4 * 3.75 - 1
14.0
</code>
        <p>
          In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable _. This means that when you are
          using Python as a desk calculator, it is somewhat easier to continue calculations, for example:
        </p>
        <code>
>>> tax = 12.5 / 100
>>> price = 100.50
>>> price * tax
12.5625
>>> price + _
113.0625
>>> round(_, 2)
113.06
</code>
        <p>This variable should be treated as read-only by the user. Don’t explicitly assign a value to it — you would
          create an independent local variable with the same name masking the built-in variable with its magic behavior.

          In addition to int and float, Python supports other types of numbers, such as Decimal and Fraction. Python
          also has built-in support for complex numbers, and uses the j or J suffix to indicate the imaginary part (e.g.
          3+5j).</p>
        <p> First Steps Towards Programming</p>
        <p>Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together. For instance, we
          can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows:</p>
        <code>>>> # Fibonacci series:
... # the sum of two elements defines the next
... a, b = 0, 1
>>> while a < 10:
...     print(a)
...     a, b = b, a+b
...
0
1
1
2
3
5
8</code>
        <p>This example introduces several new features.
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The first line contains a multiple assignment: the variables a and b simultaneously get the new values 0 and
            1. On the last line this is used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side are all
            evaluated first before any of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from
            the left to the right.
          </li>
          <li>
            The while loop executes as long as the condition (here: a < 10) remains true. In Python, like in C, any
              non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact
              any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false. The test used in the
              example is a simple comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same as in C: < (less
              than),> (greater than), == (equal to), <= (less than or equal to),>= (greater than or equal to) and !=
                (not equal to).
          </li>
          <li>
            The body of the loop is indented: indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements. At the interactive
            prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more
            complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When
            a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion
            (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a basic block
            must be indented by the same amount.
          </li>
          <li>The print() function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given. It differs from just writing the
            expression you want to write (as we did earlier in the calculator examples) in the way it handles multiple
            arguments, floating point quantities, and strings. Strings are printed without quotes, and a space is
            inserted between items, so you can format things nicely, like this:<code>>>> i = 256*256
>>> print('The value of i is', i)
The value of i is 65536</code>
            The keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with a
            different string:
            <code>>>> a, b = 0, 1
>>> while a < 1000:
...     print(a, end=',')
...     a, b = b, a+b
...
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,</code>
          </li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Strings</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be
          enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result 2. \ can be used to escape
          quotes:
        </p>
        <code>
    >>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
'spam eggs'
>>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...
"doesn't"
>>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead
"doesn't"
>>> '"Yes," they said.'
'"Yes," they said.'
>>> "\"Yes,\" they said."
'"Yes," they said.'
>>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
'"Isn\'t," they said.'
  </code>
        <p>In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes and special characters are escaped
          with backslashes. While this might sometimes look different from the input (the enclosing quotes could
          change), the two strings are equivalent. The string is enclosed in double quotes if the string contains a
          single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single quotes. The print() function produces a
          more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special characters:</p>
        <code>
    >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
'"Isn\'t," they said.'
>>> print('"Isn\'t," they said.')
"Isn't," they said.
>>> s = 'First line.\nSecond line.'  # \n means newline
>>> s  # without print(), \n is included in the output
'First line.\nSecond line.'
>>> print(s)  # with print(), \n produces a new line
First line.
Second line.
  </code>
        <p>
          If you don’t want characters prefaced by \ to be interpreted as special characters, you can use raw strings by
          adding an r before the first quote:
        </p>
        <code>
    >>> print('C:\some\name')  # here \n means newline!
C:\some
ame
>>> print(r'C:\some\name')  # note the r before the quote
C:\some\name
  </code>
        <p>String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''. End of lines
          are automatically included in the string, but it’s possible to prevent this by adding a \ at the end of the
          line. The following example:</p>
        <code>
    print("""\
Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
   -h                        Display this usage message
   -H hostname               Hostname to connect to
""")
  </code>
        <p>
          produces the following output (note that the initial newline is not included):
        </p>
        <code>
  Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
   -h                        Display this usage message
   -H hostname               Hostname to connect to
</code>
        <p>trings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with *:</p>
        <code>
 >>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'
>>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'
'unununium' 
</code>
        <p>Two or more string literals (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes) next to each other are automatically
          concatenated.
        <p>
          <code>
    >>> 'Py' 'thon'
'Python'
  </code>
        <p>
          The built-in function len() returns the length of a string:
        </p>
        <code>
    >>> s = 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'
>>> len(s)
34
    </code>

    <section class="main-section" id="If_Statements">
      <header>
        <h2>If Statements</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:</p>
        <code>
    >>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
>>> if x < 0:
...     x = 0
...     print('Negative changed to zero')
... elif x == 0:
...     print('Zero')
... elif x == 1:
...     print('Single')
... else:
...     print('More')
...
More
  </code>
        <p>There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else
          if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the
          switch or case statements found in other languages.

          If you’re comparing the same value to several constants, or checking for specific types or attributes, you may
          also find the match statement useful. For more details see match Statements.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="For_Statements">

        <h2>For Statements<h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always
          iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define
          both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any
          sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):
        </p>
        <code>
>>> # Measure some strings:
... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
>>> for w in words:
...     print(w, len(w))
...
cat 3
window 6
defenestrate 12
</code>
        <p>
          Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right. Instead,
          it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:
        </p>
        <code>
# Create a sample collection
users = {'Hans': 'active', 'Éléonore': 'inactive', '景太郎': 'active'}

# Strategy:  Iterate over a copy
for user, status in users.copy().items():
  if status == 'inactive':
      del users[user]

# Strategy:  Create a new collection
active_users = {}
for user, status in users.items():
  if status == 'active':
      active_users[user] = status

          If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy. It
          generates arithmetic progressions:
        </p>
        <code>
>>> for i in range(5):
...     print(i)
...
0
1
2
3
4
</code>
        <p>
          The given end point is never part of the generated sequence; range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices
          for items of a sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a
          different increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’):
        </p>
        <code>
>>> list(range(5, 10))
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

>>> list(range(0, 10, 3))
[0, 3, 6, 9]

>>> list(range(-10, -100, -30))
[-10, -40, -70]
</code>
        <p>
          To iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine range() and len() as follows:
        </p>
        <code>
>>> a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
>>> for i in range(len(a)):
...     print(i, a[i])
...
0 Mary
1 had
2 a
3 little
4 lamb
</code>
        <p>
          In most such cases, however, it is convenient to use the enumerate() function, see Looping Techniques.

          A strange thing happens if you just print a range:
        </p>
        <code>
>>> range(10)
range(0, 10)
</code>
        <p>
          In many ways the object returned by range() behaves as if it is a list, but in fact it isn’t. It is an object
          which returns the successive items of the desired sequence when you iterate over it, but it doesn’t really
          make the list, thus saving space.
        </p>
        <p>
          We say such an object is iterable, that is, suitable as a target for functions and constructs that expect
          something from which they can obtain successive items until the supply is exhausted. We have seen that the for
          statement is such a construct, while an example of a function that takes an iterable is sum():
        </p>
        <code>
>>> sum(range(4))  # 0 + 1 + 2 + 3
6
</code>
        <p>
          Later we will see more functions that return iterables and take iterables as arguments. In chapter Data
          Structures, we will discuss in more detail about list().
